# Pricing a Call Option with the Binomial Model


I priced a Call Option using the Binomial Model.

Three different computations were made:

    - pricing a Google option with maturity 3 months
    - pricing a BioNTech option with maturity 3 months
    - pricing a BioNTech option with maturity 6 months


Here the last 3 months prices of Google stocks:
